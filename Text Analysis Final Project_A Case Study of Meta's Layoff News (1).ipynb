    "## Background and Motivations for Research\n",
    "\n",
    "In stark contrast to its mid-pandemic boom, the tech industry is facing a number of challenges including rising inflation and a potential recession that constrains company spending, and increased scrutiny from regulators around the world that makes it more difficult to operate and grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, chain bankruptcies in the banking industry including Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse make it difficult for tech companies to access capital for essential company operations(__[Daily Mail, 2023](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11845803/SVB-collapse-major-impact-tech-industry.html)__). All of these factors combined have led leading tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon to announce mass layoffs, raising concerns about the health of the tech industry and the future of the tech workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta was the first among Big Tech to announce mass layoffs due to rising costs, declining ad revenue, and increased competition from companies like TikTok and Snapchat (__[CNN, 2023](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/tech/meta-tech-team-layoffs-begin/index.html#:~:text=Meta%20has%20said%20the%20layoffs,building%20the%20so%2Dcalled%20metaverse)__). It announced two rounds of layoffs in the past year. The first round, announced on November 9th 2022 (__[Meta, 2022](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/)__), affected 11,000 employees. The second round, announced on March 14th 2023 (__[Meta, 2023](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/)__), affected 10,000 employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of such macroeconomic events, I thought it might be an interesting time to see if online sentiment of a company’s events would have an impact on its stock performance. How would investors perceive an event like mass layoffs? Do their perceptions translate into real returns in the stock market?\n"

    "## Research Questions and Hypotheses\n",
    "In this project, I will investigate the impact of online sentiment on the share prices of big tech companies. I use Meta’s layoffs as a case study as it was the first Big Tech company to announce mass layoffs and there was the most buzz around its decision online. My research questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Does online sentiment regarding Meta's layoffs have an impact on (or at least a correlation with) Meta's share prices?</li>\n",
    "<li>How do investors and the public perceive layoffs? What about a second round of layoffs?</li>\n",
    "<li>Which publishers have more predictive/explanatory power?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypotheses are the following:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>There is a linear relationship between online sentiment expressed on Meta's layoffs news and its share prices. Negative online sentiments are expected to have a negative impact on share prices. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The first round of layoffs might alarm investors (negative online sentiment) and drive down stock prices, but a second round of layoffs might signal business frugality (positive online sentiment) and lead to higher stock prices, especially as other tech companies follow through with the trend of laying off workers. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Financial advisory websites like The Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha have more predictive power on the stock market than financial news outlets like The Wall Street Journal or Financial Times. That is, the trends in their online sentiments will be more closely aligned with the trends in the stock market. I hypothesize so because these websites often help retail investors buy suggesting whether to buy or sell a stock. </li>\n"

    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I use two sources of data. My historical stock price data comes from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META/history/), which describes the opening and closing stock prices of Meta for the past year. My sentiment data comes from [Aylien](https://aylien.com/product/news-api), a news scraping website similar to News API. Because I was using the free version, I was only able to scrape 100 articles per search. However, Aylien had an advantage over News API in that it allowed me to scrape articles published in 6 months ago (News API only lets you scrape articles published up to a month ago). Using Aylien’s API, I was able to access articles published by financial news outlets and financial advisory websites. Here are the publishers I specified in my API parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Financial news outlets: Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Financial Times, Forbes, The Economist, Bloomberg, Yahoo! Finance, CNBC, CNN, Business Insider, and TechCrunch</li>\n",
    "<li>Financial advisory websites: Market Watch, The Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, Zacks Investment Research, Money Morning, Stock Rover, Morningstar</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "I filtered the articles according to date published and keywords in the title and body. For my article dates, I picked a range of 10 days (6 days before and 4 days after the layoff announcements) to see the day trends before and after the announcement. I create 4 data frames to complete my analysis. They are data frames containing data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Articles on first round layoffs in November, 2022 from financial news outlets </li>\n",
    "    <li>Articles on first round layoffs in November, 2022 from financial advisory websites </li>\n",
    "    <li>Articles on second round layoffs in March, 2023 from financial news outlets </li>\n",
    "    <li>Articles on second round layoffs in March, 2023 from financial advisory websites </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are my code blocks for calling the Aylien API, importing the data, and storing them in data frames:"

Contrary to news sentiment, advisory website sentiment decreased sharply when layoffs were announced but immediately rebounded to follow a similar trend with stock prices."

    "## Revisiting My Hypotheses\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1:** Overall, it looks like layoffs are generally met with a lower sentiment response online (though still positive) but adjust quickly to a higher score in the days following. In contrast, the stock market responds extremely positively to the announcement of layoffs. This is slightly divergent from my hypothesis of there being a linear positive trend between sentiment scores and stock prices. This could signal that online sentiment can be reactive, not predictive, of the stock market. Perhaps news outlets and financial advisory websites adjusted their sentiment after they saw that stock performance was good.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: When my findings were different from my first hypothesis, my initial conclusion was that sentiment analysis is not a good tool to capture a relationship with stock market reactions because I thought VADER wasn’t able to distinguish the connotation of finance specific keywords like ‘buy’ or ‘sell’. However, I noticed that it was correctly reflecting trends in the stock market in sentiment scores *after* the layoffs were announced so now I believe that my first conclusion might have been a hasty one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2:** My second hypothesis was that the first round of layoffs might alarm investors, create negative online sentiment, and drive down stock prices, but a second round of layoffs might signal business prudentce, create positive online sentiment, and lead to higher stock prices. Once again this hypothesis was only met halfway. The second round of layoffs were indeed met with a more positive online response than the first round. On average, sentiment scores are much higher in articles published in March than in November, suggesting that the second round of layoffs is being perceived more positively. Although layoffs can signal a company is struggling, they can also be a positive sign to investors that a company is making moves to remain profitable (__[Forbes, 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/03/07/meta-stock-climbs-after-reports-of-more-layoffsheres-why/?sh=7527c8734f52)__). Here I suggest that the positive signaling effect is greater in the second round of layoffs, and is met with better media reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, my hypothesis regarding the first round of layoffs was wrong. In fact, the first round of layoffs were not perceived negatively. Sentiment scores from news media and advisory websites were both positive, just lower than that for the second round of layoffs. Furthermore, the stock market reacted very positively to both rounds of layoff announcements. This implies that layoffs’ positive signaling effect to investors was generally greater to investors than the negative signaling effect in the case of Meta. Further research is encouraged to check if this is the case for other Big Tech companies as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 3:** My last hypothesis was that I also find that on average, financial advisory websites seem to follow stock prices more closely than financial news media. However, this only holds true *after* a major event like layoffs happens. Their trend lines are on average, more aligned with the stock market than news sentiment trend lines after Nov 9th and March 14th. Further research would be needed to conclude whether one or the other type of publisher is better at actually influencing the stock market *during* (the day of) a major company event. The fact that online sentiment on advisory websites and stock prices are aligned *after* the layoff announcement might mean that there is a real time sentiment mismatch between advisory websites catered to retail investors and larger institutional investors (not reflected in my sentiment analysis) who rely on their own investment principles. Because an event like mass company layoffs are traditionally perceived as negative, financial media might initially perceive this as a negative sign and sentiment scores fall."

    "## Conclusion: Relevance for the Financial and Policymaking Community\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a growing body of research that suggests that online sentiment can have a significant impact on share prices. Negative online sentiment of a company can lead to a decline in intraday stock prices, while positive online sentiment can lead to an increase in stock prices (__[Renault, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426617301589)__, and __[Wang, Yu, and Shen, 2020](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4754025/)__).\n",
    "\n",
    "My research suggests that such findings may not necessarily hold in the case of a major company event like mass layoffs, where public sentiment/perception of company value might be just one step behind that of institutional and larger investors. Larger institutional investors might be better at interpreting mixed signal events like layoffs, and drive the stock market up during the same day. To confirm my new hypothesis, it would be necessary to conduct more research on other companies’ layoff events and incorporate a larger time frame to see if there’s a similar trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important finding for investors, policymakers, and the tech industry as a whole. Although financial sentiment analysis is a trendy tool that is being increasingly welcomed by the financial community, it suggests that online sentiment may not necessarily be reliable in the face of a company event that can send mixed signals. This might be especially relevant when it comes to protecting retail investors that might rely more on financial advisory websites than bigger investors. Policymakers should develop a better understanding for when online sentiment analysis accurately reflects market performance when designing regulations regarding tech and finance industries. It should further investigate which type of investors employ these tools more and build measures to protect smaller investors.\n"
