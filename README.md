Abstract
This research project investigates the impact of online sentiment on the share prices of big tech companies, using Meta's layoffs as a case study. The project aims to answer research questions including whether online sentiment regarding Meta's layoffs have an impact on (or at least a correlation with) Meta's share prices, how investors and the public perceive layoffs, and which publishers have more predictive/explanatory power. The study hypothesizes a linear relationship between online sentiment expressed on Meta's layoffs news and its share prices, with negative online sentiments expected to have a negative impact on share prices. The study uses historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and sentiment data from Aylien, a news scraping website. The data is filtered and explored using word clouds and topic modeling. I conclude that while online sentiment does have a positive correlation with intraday stock prices on an average day, this may not hold in the case of an event like mass layoffs, which is an event that sends mixed signals to investors and the public. I also conclude that financial advisory websites like The Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha have more predictive/explanatory power on the stock market than financial news outlets like the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times.
